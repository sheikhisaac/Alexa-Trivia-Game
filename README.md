# Alexa-Trivia-Game
This is a basic trivia game I created for Amazon's Alexa.

It includes an index class to handle everything, a questions class to import any number of trivia questions, and the necessary intent schema and sample utterances to make it work.

The content of the trivia is focused around Riot Games' League of Legends.
